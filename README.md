This repository is the official code repository from 2015 to the start of 2018. There are two phases of this code, #1 CherryIO, #2 Recode.  

### Phase #1 (CherryIO):  
When Atlas__ purchased DungeonRealms from Minecade, his development team, CherryIO recoded Minecade's code. Unfortunately, it was still very poor quality, and was barely a step-up from the original code.

### Phase #2 (Recode):
In Spring 2017, much of the game was recoded and systems were built. However, this recode quickly fell apart when the database code was implemented, and when the new owners decided to prioritize short-term additions over long-term maintainability.

While this code is still an improvement on original DungeonRealms code, it is still an absolute nightmare to work in.
For this reason, we have ditched this code and have completely recoded the game again, a recode far superior than any of the code here.

## This is an official DungeonRealms code release, released for these reasons:
 - We want to preserve the history of DungeonRealms. It has been very useful during development to have access to these code backups, it has allowed us to figure out how the game used to work, since no staff members from back then remain.
 - We want the players to have an accurate history of DungeonRealms, how the game used to work.
 - We want to encourage players experimenting. If players are able to create and test their own ideas, these ideas could be implemented into DungeonRealms, and we may find future developers.
